  """Multi-threaded version of os.walk().

  This routine provides multiple orders of a magnitude performance improvement
  when top is mapped to a network filesystem where i/o operations are slow, but
  unlimited. For spinning disks it should still run faster regardless of thread
  count because it uses a LIFO scheduler that guarantees locality. For SSDs it
  will go tolerably slower.

  The more exotic coroutine features of os.walk() can not be supported, such as
  the ability to selectively inhibit recursion by mutating subdirs.

  Args:
    top: Path of parent directory to search recursively.
    threads: Size of fixed thread pool.

  Yields:
    A (path, subdirs, files) tuple for each directory within top, including
    itself. These tuples come in no particular order; however, the contents of
    each tuple itself is sorted.
